When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would want to use a remote repo when I want to add something quick and pull later or an important message/update for other people who are working on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A fork is a copy of an other repo within github. A clone can be a clone of a repo within github or one from github to your local. A branch is a commit history inline with one another, a "branch" of some code. I would use a fork if I wanted to use code from someone elses repo either locally, or within github, and give them credit for it, I would clone a repo if I wanted to import a repo. locally. A branch I would use if I wanted to make a change or try to fix a bug or add new features to some files/code I am working on locally.
